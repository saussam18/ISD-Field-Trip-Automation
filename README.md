# ISD-Field-Trip-Automation
This is going to be a list of the work that is still to be done on it, we did the best we could to finish this on time but it proved to be too much of a challenge for the time we allowed ourselves

1. Fill out form conversion: Right now when the form is filled out it is done so on the client side in js, but we need the entire thing to be converted into a php object and then seralize to be able to save it into the database.
 We could not figure this out in time and this was required for the rest of our project to be complete.
2. Create the php object and save it into the database: This task was just a simple few lines but the crucial part was that it would have to work exactly right. Needed the previous task to work before we could even start on this one
3. Connect the form to the class: Would just have to be a string in the object with the class name and then we could just do a similar scan of the students as we did for listing them out in the class.
It would be an easy way to connect them
4. Have the students and parents fill out the rest of the form: This required a similar thing to the creating the form, would just be an extension of the object and stuff.
This would of also required a ton of work and conversion to a pdf would be needed to possibly print out or send to the teacher, giving a check to the students
5. Secure the database and PHP code: Right now if the site was put up, it would be extremely vulnerable to SQL injection, which essentially ruins our database.
We would have to tighten up everything so that this would not happen and the website still works. We however wanted to finish the functionality first.
6. Pretty up the website: Right now the website looks really bare with not a lot of flavor or functions with buttons and the sort, so we would have to do a lot more simplifying of the features and make sure everything still works.
Not a high priority but still would be nice
7. Optimization: Make sure that everything is running as efficiently as possible
