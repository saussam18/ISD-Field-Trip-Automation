Getting Around:
pwd  = print working directory
ls = list contents in current working directory
cd 'name of directory' = change directory
cd .. = goes back up a directory
cd ~ = goes to home directory
git = lists out more git
git status = will tell you what changes you made to your file since your last push/pull

Setting up an SSH Key to connect your computer to Github:
  1. type 'cd ~'
  2. type 'ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" '
     (instead of your_email@example.com put your email you used for github)
  3. This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.
  4. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter.
    This accepts the default file location.
  5. When prompted to input password put password if you want. (Personally I don't recommend it gets super annoying super fast)
  6. Your ssh key in now generated :)
  7. type cd '~/.ssh'
  8. If you hit 'ls' you should see your key (it is the .pub file)
  9. type 'cat id_rsa.pub'(this will print out your key)
  10. Copy your ssh key using right click copy ('ctrl + c' won't work).
  11. Go to github.com and in your settings there will be a setting for 'SSH and GPG keys', click on that.
  12. Click new SSH key and give it a name and paste your ssh key where it says key.

Connecting your computer to your repository:
  1. Open file explorer and in your home directory create a new folder called 'github'
  2. In git bash type 'cd github'
  3. go to your repository in github and click on where it says 'clone or download
  4. Make sure it says 'clone with ssh' and copy that link
  5. In git bash type 'git clone ' and right click paste your link (again ctrl+v won't work). Then hit enter.
  6. hit 'ls' and you should be able to see your repository listed
  7. change directory to your new repository, and now you are able to push and pull to github.

Syncing your computer to Github repo:
  1. be in the project directory in gitbash
  2. git pull = syncs your computer to Github

Saving your changes to Github:
  1. be in the project directory in gitbash
  2. Do a git pull first!!!
  3. git add -A = this will add all changes you made to an index (package)
  4. git commit -m "your message" = Will send/commit your index to github. If you accidently forgot '-m'
     then STILL write your commit message however when you are done press 'esc' then type ':wq' then hit enter
  5. git push = finalizes and pushes everything to the cloud
