Getting Around:
pwd  = print working directory
ls = list contents in current working directory
cd 'name of directory' = change directory
cd .. = goes back up a directory
cd ~ = goes to home directory
git = lists out more git
git status = will tell you what changes you made since your last push/pull

Setting up an SSH Key to connect your computer to Github:
  1. type 'cd ~'
  2. type 'ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" '
     (instead of your_email@example.com put your email you used for github)
  3. This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.
  4. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter.
    This accepts the default file location.
  5. When prompted to input password put password if you want. (Personally I don't recommend it gets super annoying)

Syncing your computer to Github repo:
  1. be in the project directory in gitbash
  2. git pull = syncs your computer to Github

Saving your changes to Github:
  1. be in the project directory in gitbash
  2. git add -A = this will add all changes you made to an index (package)
  3. git commit -m "your message" = Will send/commit your index to github. If you accidently forgot '-m'
     then STILL write your commit message however when you are done press 'esc' then type ':wq' then hit enter
  4. git push = finalizes and pushes everything to the cloud
